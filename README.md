# Roster Generator
Have you ever needed to generate a monthly roster for your co-workers?
No?
Well my client did. SO I made this for him.

## How to use
- Clone this repo
- `$ npm install`
- `$ node app.js`
- Go to `http://localhost:8080`

## Add employees
The whole premise of this app is to generate a table that shows which people show up on which days, at which shifts.
Add employees to the roster by clicking on "Manage Employees" on the homepage.

## Generate the roster
Navigate back to the homepage, then click on "Create Roster"
Choose the month and year for which you want to generate it for (by default it will be the current month and year).
Click generate, and a (big) table will appear on the bottom. You can then copy this into excel or any other spreadsheet program of your choosing.

Have fun!
